# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an AI-powered voice assistant specifically designed to provide mental health support for students. The assistant will offer multiple interaction modes (voice-to-voice, text-to-text, and voice-to-text) to accommodate different user preferences and situations. The system will leverage free Hugging Face APIs to provide natural, human-like conversations that create a comfortable and supportive environment for students seeking mental health guidance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student experiencing stress or anxiety, I want to have voice conversations with an AI assistant, so that I can receive immediate mental health support in a natural, conversational way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student speaks to the assistant THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text accurately
2. WHEN the system processes the student's input THEN it SHALL generate appropriate mental health guidance using AI
3. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL convert it to natural-sounding speech
4. WHEN the voice output is played THEN it SHALL sound human-like and pleasant to encourage continued conversation
5. IF the student mentions crisis keywords THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate crisis resources and emergency contacts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student who prefers text communication, I want to chat with the AI assistant through text, so that I can receive mental health support in a format I'm comfortable with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student types a message THEN the system SHALL process the text input directly
2. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN it SHALL display the text response immediately
3. WHEN the conversation continues THEN the system SHALL maintain context throughout the text session
4. IF the student requests voice output THEN the system SHALL provide an option to hear the response spoken aloud

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student with accessibility needs, I want to speak to the assistant and receive text responses, so that I can interact in the most comfortable way for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student speaks to the assistant THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text accurately
2. WHEN the system processes the input THEN it SHALL generate appropriate mental health guidance
3. WHEN the AI response is ready THEN the system SHALL display it as text only
4. WHEN the student continues speaking THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context across voice inputs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student seeking mental health support, I want the AI to provide evidence-based guidance and coping strategies, so that I receive helpful and appropriate mental health assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student describes mental health concerns THEN the system SHALL provide evidence-based coping strategies
2. WHEN the AI detects potential mental health issues THEN it SHALL offer appropriate resources and techniques
3. WHEN a student asks for specific help THEN the system SHALL provide relevant mental health information
4. IF the AI cannot provide adequate support THEN it SHALL recommend professional mental health resources
5. WHEN providing guidance THEN the system SHALL maintain a supportive, non-judgmental tone

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing this system, I want to use free Hugging Face APIs, so that the solution remains cost-effective while providing quality AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing speech-to-text THEN the system SHALL use free Hugging Face models or APIs
2. WHEN implementing text-to-speech THEN the system SHALL use free Hugging Face models that produce natural-sounding voices
3. WHEN implementing the conversational AI THEN the system SHALL use free Hugging Face language models suitable for mental health support
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL operate within free tier limitations of chosen APIs
5. IF API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle rate limiting and provide appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student using the assistant, I want my conversations to be private and secure, so that I feel safe sharing personal mental health information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student interacts with the assistant THEN the system SHALL not store personal conversation data permanently
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL handle data securely during the session
3. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL clear temporary conversation data
4. WHEN using external APIs THEN the system SHALL ensure data is transmitted securely
