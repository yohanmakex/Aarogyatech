# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a multi-role login system for the MindCare application that allows different types of users (students, counselors, and administrators) to access their respective interfaces from a single login page. The system will route users to appropriate dashboards based on their role while maintaining the existing MindCare design theme and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to login through a role-specific option on the main page, so that I can access the student mental health support interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student selects the "Student" login option THEN the system SHALL display student-specific login fields
2. WHEN a student enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them as a student user
3. WHEN student authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the main MindCare interface
4. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL maintain their session and display student-appropriate features
5. IF student credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a counselor, I want to login through a dedicated counselor option, so that I can access the counselor dashboard with appropriate monitoring and support tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a counselor selects the "Counselor" login option THEN the system SHALL display counselor-specific login fields
2. WHEN a counselor enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them with counselor privileges
3. WHEN counselor authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the counselor dashboard
4. WHEN a counselor accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display counselor-appropriate features and analytics
5. IF counselor credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to login through an admin option, so that I can access the full administrative dashboard with complete system management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects the "Admin" login option THEN the system SHALL display admin-specific login fields
2. WHEN an admin enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them with full administrative privileges
3. WHEN admin authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the admin dashboard
4. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all administrative features including user management
5. IF admin credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of any role, I want the login interface to be intuitive and clearly indicate different access levels, so that I can easily identify and select the appropriate login option.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main page THEN the system SHALL display clear role selection options (Student, Counselor, Admin)
2. WHEN a user selects a role THEN the system SHALL update the interface to show role-appropriate login fields
3. WHEN displaying role options THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators and descriptions for each role
4. WHEN a user switches between roles THEN the system SHALL update the form fields and validation accordingly
5. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing MindCare purple gradient theme and design consistency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based authentication and authorization, so that users can only access features appropriate to their role level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL verify credentials against role-specific user databases or validation rules
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL store their role information securely in the session
3. WHEN routing users THEN the system SHALL direct them to role-appropriate interfaces based on their authenticated role
4. WHEN users access features THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions and restrictions
5. IF a user attempts to access unauthorized features THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the multi-role login to integrate seamlessly with existing authentication systems, so that current functionality is preserved while adding new capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new login system THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing student login functionality
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL preserve existing session management and security measures
3. WHEN integrating with admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL use existing admin authentication mechanisms
4. WHEN routing users THEN the system SHALL preserve existing URL structures and navigation patterns
5. WHEN updating the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain existing accessibility features and multi-language support
